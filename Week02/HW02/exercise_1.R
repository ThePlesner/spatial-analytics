#### Goals ####

# - Modify the provided code to improve the resulting map

# We highlighted all parts of the R script in which you are supposed to add your
# own code with: 

# /Start Code/ #

print("Hello World") # This would be your code contribution

# /End Code/ #

#### Required R libraries ####

# We will use the sf, raster, and tmap packages.
# Additionally, we will use the spData and spDataLarge packages that provide new datasets.
# These packages have been preloaded to the worker2 workspace.

library(sf)
library(raster)
library(tmap)
library(spData)
library(spDataLarge)

#### Data sets #### 

# We will use two data sets: `nz_elev` and `nz`. They are contained by the libraries
# The first one is an elevation raster object for the New Zealand area, and the second one is an sf object with polygons representing the 16 regions of New Zealand.

#### Existing code ####

# We wrote the code to create a new map of New Zealand.
# Your role is to improve this map based on the suggestions below.

#### Exercise I ####

# 1. Change the map title from "My map" to "New Zealand".
# 2. Update the map credits with your own name and today's date.
# 3. Change the color palette to "-RdYlGn". 
#    (You can also try other palettes from http://colorbrewer2.org/)
# 4. Put the north arrow in the top right corner of the map.
# 5. Improve the legend title by adding the used units (m asl).
# 6. Increase the number of breaks in the scale bar.
# 7. Change the borders' color of the New Zealand's regions to black. 
#    Decrease the line width.
# 8. Change the background color to any color of your choice.

tm_shape(nz_elev)  +
  tm_raster(title = "elev m.", 
            style = "cont",
            palette = "-RdYlGn") +
  tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_borders(col = "black", 
             lwd = 1) +
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 50, 100, 150, 200),
               text.size = 1) +
  tm_compass(position = c("RIGHT", "top"),
             type = "rose", 
             size = 2) +
  tm_credits(text = "M, Plesner, 2021") +
  tm_layout(main.title = "New Zealand",
            bg.color = "#42a7f5",
            inner.margins = c(0, 0, 0, 0))

#### Exercise II ####

# 9. Read two new datasets, `srtm` and `zion`, using the code below.
#    To create a new map representing these datasets.

srtm = raster(system.file("raster/srtm.tif", package = "spDataLarge"))
zion = read_sf(system.file("vector/zion.gpkg", package = "spDataLarge"))

# Your solution

# /Start Code/ #
tm_shape(srtm)  +
  tm_raster(title = "Elev. m. asl", 
            style = "cont",
            palette = "-RdYlGn") +
  tm_shape(zion) +
  tm_borders(col = "blue", 
             lwd = 1) +
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 2, 4, 6, 8),
               position = c("LEFT", "bottom"),
               text.size = 1) +
  tm_compass(position = c("RIGHT", "top"),
             type = "rose", 
             size = 2) +
  tm_credits(text = "M.Plesner, 2021-02-14",
             position = c("LEFT", "bottom"),) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Zion National Park",
            legend.position = c("left","center"),
            inner.margins = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
